# Deep Learning using PyTorch

This is a set of tutorials that I will be releasing (hopefully) weekly.

## Running in Colab

Here are the instructions on how to get the notebook.

**Step 1. Open the notebook in Colab**

Every notebook will have colab icon <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon.ico" width=16/> on the top.
Clicking it will redirect you to the Google Colab notebooks where you can run the tutorials in the cloud.

After clicking on "Authorize" follow the instruction to log into the GitHub.

**Step 2. Select the runtime type**

Sometimes you will need to use a GPU.
To do that, in the colab notebook select "Runtime" -> "Change runtime type"

Choose the type that you'd like:
- `None` runs the notebook only on CPU
- `GPU` / `TPU` runs the notebook on gpu/tpu

**Step 3. Edit and Run**
You can edit any cell in the notebook by double clicking it.
You can run individual cells or an entire notebook using the "Runtime" menu.
You can also run the currently selected notebook using `Shift+Enter`.

## TODOs

1. Write up the documentation on
  1. Installation instructions
  2. How to use Jupyter Notebooks in Colab
